/*
 * A sequence of numbers is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences between successive numbers
 * strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be
 * either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a zig-zag
 * sequence.
 * 
 * For example, 1,7,4,9,2,5 is a zig-zag sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are
 * alternately positive and negative. In contrast, 1,4,7,2,5 and 1,7,4,5,5 are not zig-zag
 * sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its
 * last difference is zero.
 * 
 * Given a sequence of integers, sequence, return the length of the longest subsequence of sequence
 * that is a zig-zag sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements
 * (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original
 * order.
